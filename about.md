# About

Ruby on Racetracks enables faster Ruby on Rails development while doubling down on quality control by adhering to these core principles:
1. Basic and routine tasks should be quick and easy.
2. A photographic memory should NOT be a requirement.
3. The same app should behave exactly the same way for everyone, regardless of the operating systems installed on their machines or specific details of their system configurations.
4. Large tasks should be broken down into many smaller tasks.
