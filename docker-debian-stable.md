# Why are your Docker images based on Debian's stable branch?
* Debian is a very widely used Linux distro, and the Debian-based distros are what I'm used to using.  Because Debian is widely used, support is excellent, and help is easy to find.
* Debian Stable is lower in maintenance needs than Debian Testing.
* Debian is lighter, faster, and lower in maintenance needs than its Ubuntu derivative.
