# Jekyll Site

This site is created by a script that downloads the [Bitwiser](https://github.com/brijeshb42/bitwiser) source code and then adds the scripts I created at [https://github.com/jhsu802701/jekyll-bitwiser](https://github.com/jhsu802701/jekyll-bitwiser) to streamline the deployment processes.

## What's wrong with deploying to GitHub?
* It supports only the minima theme.  If you want to use any other theme, you're out of luck.
* The _site directory has to be saved in the source code.

## What's wrong with deploying to GitLab?
* I deployed a site with the Bitwiser theme, but the Bitwiser formatting did not work there.

## What's wrong with deploying to Heroku?
* It's a convoluted and unreliable process.
* Heroku does not officially support Jekyll.

## Why are BitBalloon, Netlify, and Surge better?
* They provide much better support, and the procedures are easy, straightforward, and quick.
* Free accounts are available.

## Why do you need multiple possible web hosts?
These free web hosting services may discontinue service or make controversial changes that I don't like.  It's better to have multiple options to avoid emergencies.
