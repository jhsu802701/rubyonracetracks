# Rails From Scratch

I created a repository called [Rails From Scratch](https://github.com/jhsu802701/rails_from_scratch_rails5), which consists of a detailed protocol for creating a high-quality Rails app that includes the basic elements I expect to need for all or most apps.  All of the details are spelled out to speed up the process, and tests are done frequently to make sure that everything works as expected.  Because I do not have a photographic memory, I rely on this procedure to make sure I cover all bases and don't forget any details.

I use my Rails From Scratch procedure to create the template Rails app provided by my GenericApp gem.
