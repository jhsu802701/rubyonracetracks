# MX Linux

## Why do you use MX Linux?
MX Linux is fast, lightweight, polished, well-supported, user-friendly, and low maintenance.  It's so fast and lightweight that it runs well on 10-year-old PCs.

## Why don't you use Ubuntu?
* I tried the Unity interface, and it was unintuitive to me.
* The Ubuntu base has a high overhead, which means that it requires far more memory, processor speed, and other resources than MX Linux and other Debian-based distros that bypass the Ubuntu base.  This high overhead is especially significant if your computer is more than a few years old, or if you're relying on a Linux virtual machine on your Mac or Windows computer.
* That said, if you like Ubuntu, and your computer is new enough and fast enough to handle it, you are free to use it.

## Why don't you use Linux Mint?
* The traditional Ubuntu-based editions of Linux Mint have the high Ubuntu overhead.
* Linux Mint Debian Edition doesn't get as much support or attention from its development team and community as the Ubuntu-based editions do.  (To be fair, Linux Mint's main priorities are the Ubuntu-based editions and the MATE and Cinnamon desktop environments.)  I regard MX Linux as the unofficial Linux Mint Debian Edition.

## Why don't you use antiX Linux?
*  The Xfce desktop environment of MX Linux is more polished and refined than the IceWM + ROX pinboard environment of its parent distro antiX Linux.
* That said, antiX Linux is somewhat lighter and faster than MX Linux.  If you're using an old computer, consider using antiX Linux instead of MX Linux.
