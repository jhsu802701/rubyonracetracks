# Windows Users

* If you are using Windows, but removing your current Windows installation is not an option, you should install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).  Create a Linux virtual machine, and then follow my instructions for using Docker in Linux.  In other words, you will be using Ruby on Rails in a Linux virtual environment within a Linux virtual machine within your Windows host machine.
* For a demo of the process of installing a Linux virtual machine on a Windows host machine, watch my video [Linux in Windows: Installing a Linux Virtual Machine on a Windows Host Machine ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCIFtLa9yJk).
* Do NOT count on learning how to install Ruby on Rails in Windows.  Very few people know how to do this, which means that the support available is extremely limited.  Given that the well-established procedures for manually installing Ruby on Rails in OS X or Linux are painfully slow and require babysitting processes, installing Ruby on Rails in Windows is a task for Chuck Norris.
* Do NOT count on getting Bash commands to work in the Windows command line.  My attempts to do this for Windows users at the Rails.MN Meetup events did not pan out.  While Bash is not an official requirement for Ruby on Rails, I rely on the Bash command line utlities for using Docker.
