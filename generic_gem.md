# GenericGem

I created a gem called [GenericGem](https://github.com/jhsu802701/generic_gem) for creating gems. When you use this gem, it created a very basic gem with Rspec tests, a 1-step test script, RuboCop, Bundler-Audit, and other basic needs common to all gems already provided. This takes care of many of the loose ends that annoyed me when I had to take care of the generic details manually.
