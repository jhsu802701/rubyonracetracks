# GenericApp

## What's the Point?
* Creating a basic generic web site with user authentication and testing is a long and slow process that spans multiple long chapters in [Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/). The [GenericApp](https://github.com/jhsu802701/generic_app) Ruby gem allows you to create such a site in minutes instead of hours. This is valuable for any project and essential for events like Startup Weekend and 24-hour website challenges.
* GenericApp saves you time by automatically providing the basic elements and features that nearly all Rails apps require. Instead of spending hours reinventing the wheel, you can spend more of your time on the more advanced features and capabilities that are unique to your specific Rails app. Modifying a generic app takes far less time than creating an app completely from scratch.
* At the same time GenericApp provides superior quality.  Unlike other Rails app generating systems, GenericApp INCLUDES comprehensive model, controller, and integration tests.  The time you save allows you to get work done faster AND double down on quality control.

## How can GenericApp work so quickly?

GenericApp is the result of my procedure for [creating a Rails site from scratch](rails_from_scratch.md).  The resulting Rails app can be used as a platform for starting a very wide variety of new Rails apps.
