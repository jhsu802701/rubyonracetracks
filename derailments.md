# Derailments

Unfortunately, there are numerous ways to be derailed when working on Ruby on Rails projects.  Fortunately, Ruby on Racetracks offers solutions.

## What's wrong with the old ways of working with Ruby on Rails?
* Many of the traditional procedures used in Ruby on Rails involve long processes.  Even worse are long processes that require babysitting.  It's one thing for a long process to proceed without your intervention. It's even worse when a process cannot proceed without your intervention. Installing Windows is a classic example of this.
* It adds insult to injury when a long process fails. At least when a short process fails, it doesn't take up that much time, you don't have to wait to see the failure, and you can take corrective action that much sooner.
* When routine maintenance requires long processes, the temptation to neglect maintenance is greatly magnified.
* There are too many things that must be remembered.  Unlike most others, I do not have a photographic memory.
* Ruby on Rails is vulnerable to the infamous "Works On My Machine" problem.

## Why is Ruby on Racetracks so great?
* Ruby on Racetracks streamlines processes WITHOUT cutting corners on quality.  In fact, Ruby on Racetracks improves quality.
* Ruby on Racetracks doubles down on the sanity checks.  This reduces the risk of unexpected problems.  When things do go wrong, the troubleshooting process is much easier.  According to an old Holiday Inn slogan, the best surprise is no surprise, and I fully agree.
* Ruby on Racetracks prevents the infamous "Works On My Machine" problem by providing universal development environments that are available for Linux, Mac, and Windows users.
* Instead of relying on a photographic memory, Ruby on Racetracks relies on pre-installation, automation, and good standard operating procedures for taking care of the numerous details.
