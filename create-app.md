# Creating A Rails App

I created a gem called [GenericApp](https://github.com/jhsu802701/generic_app) for creating Rails apps.  When you use this gem, it creates a basic Rails app with common elements already provided.  These elements include a 1-step build script, MiniTest, authentication, a comprehensive suite of model/controller/integration tests, and more.
