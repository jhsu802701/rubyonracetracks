# Mac Users

* If you are using a Mac, use VirtualBox to create an MX Linux virtual machine, and then follow my instructions for installing [Docker in Linux](docker-getting_started.html).  In other words, you will be using Ruby on Rails in a Linux virtual environment within a Linux virtual machine within your Mac host.
* While Docker for Mac and Docker Toolbox are available for Mac users, you'll find that processes running under these Docker solutions are much slower than processes running under my Docker solution.  Like my solution, Docker for Mac and Docker Toolbox rely on a virtual machine as an intermediary between Mac and Docker.  The use of a virtual machine is much more obvious under my solution.
