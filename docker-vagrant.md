Docker is faster, because it provides a virtual environment but not a virtual machine.  A virtual machine is a heavy user of memory and processing power and needs a few minutes to boot up.  Docker bypasses that overhead, and this allows you to enter your Ruby on Rails development environment in no more than a few seconds.
