## Entertainment

NOTE: This is NOT an endorsement of the travel services advertised.  I simply found that these commercials summarize what Ruby on Racetracks is about.

**Holiday Inn**

The best surprise is no surprise.

**Not Exactly Hertz Commercials**

The "Not Exactly Hertz" commercials inspired my slogan for Ruby on Racetracks.

* [Johnson](http://www.adforum.com/creative-work/ad/player/28426/johnson/hertz): Is he buying it?  Not exactly.
* [Boss](http://www.adforum.com/creative-work/ad/player/28423/boss/hertz): Still counting on that promotion?  Not exactly.
* [Horserace](http://www.adforum.com/creative-work/ad/player/28425/horserace/hertz): The executives are at the gate . . . .
* Vacation: Honey, this is not exactly Hertz, OK?
