# Prerequisites

You should be familiar with Ruby and Rails.  You should learn Ruby first, because Rails won't make sense without at least a passing knowledge of Ruby. If you try to learn Rails without being familiar with Ruby, it will feel like mysterious black magic and will be difficult to make sense of.

## Ruby
* [TryRuby](http://tryruby.org/)
* [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/)

## Creating Ruby Gems
* [Make Your Own Gem](http://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/)
* [Let's Write a Gem: Part 1](http://rakeroutes.com/blog/lets-write-a-gem-part-one/)
* [Let's Write a Gem: Part 2](http://rakeroutes.com/blog/lets-write-a-gem-part-two/)

## Ruby On Rails
* [Rails For Zombies](http://railsforzombies.org/): This is a great introduction to what Rails can do. No installation of Ruby or Rails is required. Go through Rails For Zombies before going through Rails Tutorial, RailsBridge, or other tutorial sites.
